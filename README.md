# Pretty Print VS Code Extension

![PrettyPrint icon, created with Canva AI](images/icon.png)

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps users process code and Markdown files in a selected file or folder by converting them into a printable format. The extension:

1. **Converts code files to Markdown**: Any supported code file (See Supported Languages) in the selected folder is converted to a Markdown file with syntax highlighting and line numbers.
2. **Converts Markdown files to HTML**: Markdown files are then converted to HTML, combining them into one file.
3. **Prepares a Printable HTML**: It generates an HTML file that can be printed directly, with styled code blocks, line numbers, and integrated with the Katex library for rendering LaTeX.

## Features

[Change log](CHANGELOG.md)

- **Supports multiple programming languages**: See Supported Languages for more information
- **Line Numbers in Code**: Code blocks are automatically numbered for better readability when printed.
- **LaTeX Support**: Uses Katex to render LaTeX expressions in Markdown.
- **Print-Friendly HTML**: Converts Markdown to HTML with an automatic print trigger, allowing users to print the document directly from their browser.
- **Ignore files that you don't want to print**: (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Preferences: Open User Settings`. Search for `prettyprintcode.ignore` and add your patterns to ignore.
- **Custom header & footer templates**: Adjust `prettyprintcode.documentHeader` / `prettyprintcode.documentFooter` to override the per-file header and footer. Placeholders such as `{{displayPath}}`, `{{relativePath}}`, `{{fileName}}`, and their `raw` variants are supported. Pair with `prettyprintcode.headerFooterStyles` to add bespoke CSS.

## Installation

Install the extension from Visual Studio Marketplace: [Pretty Print - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ViktorLinden.prettyprintcode)

## Usage

1. **Activate the Extension**: Right click on a file or folder in the explorer and choose `Pretty Print`.  
***Alternatively***: Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Pretty Print`. Choose the `Pretty Print` command to activate it. **Select File or Folder**: You'll be prompted to select what you want to print. The extension will process the selected file, or every code and Markdown file inside the chosen folder (including sub directories).

2. **Markdown Conversion**: The extension converts code files to Markdown and places the generated files in a `print` folder next to your selection. When a folder is chosen, that folder gets the `print` directory. When a single file is chosen, the `print` directory is created alongside that file.

3. **Generate HTML**: After converting the files to Markdown, the extension combines them into a single HTML file, which is saved in the same `print` folder.

4. **Open & Print**: The HTML file will automatically open in your default web browser, where you can print the document.
